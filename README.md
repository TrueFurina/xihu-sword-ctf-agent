> ⚠️ **Honesty disclaimer (read first)**: This project's real-world competition result on the live platform was **0 accepted flags**. All "solved / pass-rate" figures in this repo refer to **offline deterministic analysis** of historical CTF problems (the `data/questions_real/` corpus), not any live contest score. We do not claim LLM autonomous reasoning capability — the real capability here is a **deterministic static analyzer (presolve)** covering common CTF categories. See [Honest KPI](#honest-kpi) below.

An open-source **AI agent framework for CTF (Capture The Flag)** competitions. The agent polls a DASCTF-style platform, triages challenges, runs deterministic solvers first, and only escalates to an LLM when static analysis misses. Built and battle-tested against the *West Lake Sword Tournament (西湖论剑)* AI CTF track.

## Why this exists

Most "CTF agents" are just an LLM with a shell. This one is the opposite: **deterministic-first**. A pre-solve layer (`core/presolve.py`) fans out dozens of ready-to-run skills (RSA attacks, stego extractors, source-code auditors, base64 multilayer decoders, …) in parallel. The LLM is a last-resort escalator, behind a whitelist, a token budget, and a wall-clock stop-loss. The result is a system that is **reproducible, debuggable, and honest about what it can and cannot do**.

### Solve pipeline

```
platform poll → triage/classify → attachment download + target probe
             → deterministic skills (49) ⇄ LLM reasoning (whitelisted providers)
             → flag validation → platform submit (fail-closed on request errors)
```

- **Supervisor architecture**: `core/main_agent.py` plans per challenge, `core/supervisor_agent.py` enforces step budgets, tool-first discipline, and the request-failure-vs-wrong-flag separation (the post-incident fix for a submit-circuit-breaker bug).
- **Deterministic-first**: `skills/` holds 49 runnable skills. `core/presolve.py` runs them before any LLM token is spent.
- **Whitelisted LLM only** (contest rule §3); multi-source fallback with 401/402 circuit breaking, per-question token budgets, heavy-model upgrade policy.
- **Race harness**: `scripts/_race_start.py --compete` = first-blood scan → stable polling → final report, with a mandatory e2e data-link preflight (fail-closed).

## Hard gates (lessons, codified)

| Gate | What | Enforced by |
|------|------|-------------|
| Test gate | real `pytest` run, no per-file fake loops | `setup.sh` (exit 1 on failure) |
| E2E gate | platform actually serves challenge data | `scripts/_e2e_verify.py`, wired into `--compete` |
| Network gate | proxy alive / LLM endpoints reachable | `scripts/_net_check.py` (`trust_env=False`) |
| Secret gate | no plaintext keys in staged files | pre-commit hook (`scripts/_scan_secrets.py`) |
| Write-lease gate | one writer per scope; out-of-scope commits rejected | `scripts/_lease.py` + pre-commit |

## Quick start

```bash
cd ctf_agent
bash setup.sh                      # venv + deps + whitelist + net check + test gate
export CTF_AGENT_LLM_PROVIDER=deepseek
export CTF_AGENT_LIGHT_MODEL=deepseek-chat
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-xxx     # your key — never commit it
.venv/Scripts/python.exe run.py --mode mock --category crypto   # offline smoke test
.venv/Scripts/python.exe run.py --mode cli                      # local practice
```

Configuration is environment-variable driven (see `config.py`): `DASCTF_TOKEN`, `DASCTF_BASE_URL`, provider API keys. **Never commit keys** — the hook refuses.

## Honest KPI

Benchmark on the `data/questions_real/` corpus (15 historical real problems), run through the **real** tool chain:

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Deterministic pipeline (presolve direct solve) | **14 / 15 (93.3%)** |
| LLM autonomous-reasoning contribution | **0 / 1** (the 1 miss is a dataset defect, not a capability gap) |

Interpretation: **capability = static-analyzer coverage**, not LLM reasoning. To solve more problem types, write more deterministic skills. We say this plainly because over-claiming is the easiest way to embarrass an open-source security tool.

## Security & compliance

This repo publishes the **engineering skeleton and methodology only**. Red lines:

1. **Real flags are never published.** All plaintext flags are stripped; only `<REDACTED>` / sha256 placeholders remain. Truth files live in `.gitignore`.
2. **No secrets in the repo.** LLM keys and platform tokens are injected via env vars / registry only.
3. **Internal contest resources are excluded** (`data/race_details/`, attachments, signatures) via `.gitignore`.
4. **Honest water-level.** We do not exaggerate capability. See above.
